# Reditor (Rust Editor)
A simple text editor writtein in Rust. Does nothing fancy (yet). It literally
just allows you to edit text, and save. You can also use it to create a new
file with text in it :).

To run, simply use:

```sh
cargo run [file]
```

- `[file]` specify which file you would like to open reditor with. This
  argument is **optional**.

## Acknowledgements
I followed [this guide](https://www.flenker.blog/hecto) to implement the text
editor in Rust.
